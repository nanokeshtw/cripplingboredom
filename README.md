# :yawning_face: CripplingBoredom

A fun project a potential challenge. I made this for myself so, when I am bored, I can click a button to rid myself of the boredom. The challenge? I promised myself I had to do whatever it was I got. (With the obvious exceptions of if I couldn't possibly do it, Ex: star gaze at 10 in the morning)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm i` then `pnpm dev`
3. Click the button
4. Do what it says! No taksie backsies!

## Contributing

I'm not sure how I want to add to this. If you have a good idea, feel free to make a pull request!

## Inspiration

I got the idea for this while going through [BoredButton.com](https://boredbutton.com). Feel free to check it out, I don't know much about it but it seems pretty cool. Although there are ads which is a little annoying.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add more activities
- [ ] Add EVEN MORE activities
- [ ] Make it look better
- [ ] Add a 'skip' button for those who can't do the activity
- [x] When you get an activity, show details on how that activity can be benefitial to you
- [ ] Add benefits for all activities
- [ ] When you get an activity, link to helpul articles or websites about getting started
- [ ] Add a way to share with friends
- [ ] Add a way to track how many times I've done each activity
- [ ] Add a way to find your activity near you, ex: if you get `go to library` then you can click to see local bookstores and libraries
- [ ] Comments on activites?
- [ ] Add a feed on activities so people can post about them doing it!
